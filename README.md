Mammography plugin for Orthanc
==============================

This plugin for [Orthanc](https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/) adds a **deep
learning algorithm to detect masses in scanned mammograms**.  The inference
algorithm produces DICOM-SR (structured reports) instances that are
stored inside Orthanc.  The DICOM-SR instance can then be displayed
using a version of the [Stone Web viewer for
Orthanc](https://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=stone-web-viewer).

Setup
-----

Make sure that Python 3 is installed with support of [virtual
environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Under
Debian/Ubuntu distributions, this can be done by running:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-venv
```

Evidently, you also have to [install
Orthanc](https://www.orthanc-server.com/download.php). The mammography
plugin requires the two following plugins for Orthanc to be installed:

* [Python plugin](https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/plugins/python.html).
* [DICOMweb plugin](https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/plugins/dicomweb.html), if you want to use the DICOM-SR viewer.


Configuration
-------------

Firstly, clone this repository:

```
$ cd /tmp/
$ git clone https://github.com/jodogne/orthanc-mammography/
```

Secondly, setup the Python virtual environment with the required
dependencies:

```
$ cd /tmp/orthanc-mammography/
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
(venv) python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
(venv) python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Thirdly, create a [configuration
file](https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/plugins/dicomweb.html#installation)
for Orthanc with Python.  A minimalist configuration file would look
like (make sure to adapt the path to the virtual environment,
depending on your version of Python):

```json
{
  "Plugins" : [
    "...list of paths to the Python and DICOMweb plugins..."
  ],
  "Python" : {
    "Path" : "./mammography.py"
  },
  "Mammography" : {
    "VirtualEnv" : "./venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/"
  }
}
```

Finally, start Orthanc using this configuration file.


Usage
-----

Two samples images from the [CBIS-DDSM
dataset](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22516629)
are available in the [`./sample-images/` folder](./sample-images/).

[Upload DICOM images of mammograms to
Orthanc](https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/book/users/cookbook.html#uploading-dicom-files).

Using the built-in [Orthanc
Explorer](http://localhost:8042/app/explorer.html) interface of
Orthanc, go down in the DICOM hierarchy until you reach a DICOM
instance whose modality is `MG` (mammogram).  The yellow button `Deep
learning for mammography` will appear.

Clicking on the button will launch the deep learning inference. Once
the inference is done (this takes about 5 seconds on a standard
laptop), Orthanc Explorer is automatically redirected to the
newly-created DICOM series that contains the DICOM-SR instance with
the results of the inference.

You can then click on the yellow button `Stone Web viewer (for
mammography)` to display the content of the DICOM-SR.
